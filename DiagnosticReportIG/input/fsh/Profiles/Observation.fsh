* hasMember ^definition = "Some observations are presented as a hierachical set of observations. In these cases each observation may not contain any useful information in isolation. Such hierachical graphs must be presented and viewed as a whole to convey the full meaning as intended by the producer."

* meta
  * tag ^definition = "Relevant searchable codes are located in various elements (code, value) depending on the type of investigation. They are all collected in tag for easier search. In hierachical sets of observations (hasMember) the codes may also be at various depth in the hierachy. All codes are in such cases collected in this element in the top-level observation. Hence a hit on a code in tag will always return a top-level observation, from which any hierarchy only needs to be nested inwards."
